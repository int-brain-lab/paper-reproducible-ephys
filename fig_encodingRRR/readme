## Figure linear encoding model
This code can be used to reproduce Figure 7.


#### Quick Start: Shortcut pipeline 
To quickly reproduce Figure 7 using preprocessed data:
1. run `python decoding_analysis.py`, the resulting figure will be saved in `./result/` directory. 

#### Full pipeline: Step-by-step workflow
Follow these steps to execute the full data preparation, model training, and decoding analysis pipeline:
1. Use `prepare_data.py` to download and preprocess the data from IBL API.
    - data will be saved in "./data/rep_ephys_22032024/downloaded/"
2. Train RRR encoding model using `train.py`.
    - trained model will be saved in f"./model/rep_ephys_22032024/{preprocess_kwargs}/"
3. Use `ensemble_data_for_decoding.py` to ensemble X (the 32-dimensional single-neuron response profile) and y (lab or area) for the decoding analysis
    - results saved in f"./result/data.npz"
4. Perform the decoding analysis using `decoding_analysis.py`.
    - figure saved in f"./result/"
