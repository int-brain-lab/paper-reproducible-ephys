## Figure Histology

Figure 2 can be reproduced by executing figure2_run.py file 
```
python fig_hist_run.py
```

or by using the following code snippet in an ipython terminal
```python

from one.api import ONE
from fig_hist.fig_hist_run import run_fig_hist
one = ONE()
run_fig_hist(one)

```
## Info
Currently raw histology data for panel B in figure 2 and figure 2 supplementary 1 has not been released and so these
figures can not be reproduced programatically.
